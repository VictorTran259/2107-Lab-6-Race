# CIS 2107 Lab 6 - Race
The purpose of this program is to simulate and display the race between the tortoise and the hare using a random number generator and preset move types. The animal positions are accessed and modified using pointers, and the display is controlled using the sleep() function. Sometimes it takes a while due to slippage.
